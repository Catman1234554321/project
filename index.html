        <p>
            Alabama, a member state of the United States of America, joined the union in 1819 as its 22nd state. Geographically, Alabama takes on a mostly rectangular form on maps, stretching out in a north-south orientation. 
            Its borders include Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, and Mississippi to the west. Access to the Gulf of Mexico is limited by the Florida panhandle, with Mobile Bay situated in the southwestern corner of Alabama. 
            The capital city of Alabama is Montgomery.[1]

            The state boasts a wide range of landscapes. In the far north, the fertile agricultural valley of the Tennessee River dominates. Moving northeastward, the rugged terrain of the southwestern Appalachian Mountains gradually unfolds, extending in a southwesterly direction across the northern portion of the state. 
            Beneath lies the swath of fertile prairie lowland known as the Black Belt, characterized by its rich soils that once supported a predominant cotton-growing culture pivotal to the state's growth. Further south, expansive pine forests give way to coastal plains, eventually leading to the iconic moss-draped live oaks 
            of Mobile and the pristine white beaches of the Gulf.[1]

            Alabama earns its nickname, the Yellowhammer State, from its state bird. Additionally, it's recognized as the "Heart of Dixie" and the "Cotton State". The longleaf pine stands as the state tree, while the camellia represents the state flower. Montgomery holds the title of Alabama's capital, while both in population and area, 
            Huntsville claims the spot as its largest city. Mobile, established in 1702 by French colonists known as Alabama Creoles, serves as the oldest city in the state and was once the capital of French Louisiana. Leading Alabama's economic charge is Greater Birmingham, its largest metropolitan area.[2]

            Originally inhabited by numerous Native American tribes, what is now Alabama became a Spanish territory in the sixteenth century, eventually passing into French hands in the early eighteenth century. Following the British acquisition in 1763, the territory was lost during the American Revolutionary War. 
            Mobile remained under Spanish control as part of Spanish West Florida until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama achieved statehood. Throughout the antebellum era, the state emerged as a significant cotton producer, heavily reliant on African American slave labor. In 1861, Alabama seceded from the United States to join the Confederate States of America, 
            with Montgomery serving as its initial capital. The state reunited with the Union in 1868. Post-Civil War, Alabama endured prolonged economic challenges, largely stemming from its agrarian economy centered around a few cash crops. Like many former slave states, Alabama implemented Jim Crow laws from the late 19th century until the 1960s. 
            Notable events such as the Selma to Montgomery march underscored Alabama's pivotal role in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.[2]
