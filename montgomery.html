        <h2>The Capital</h2>
        <p>
            Montgomery, the capital of Alabama, USA, and seat of Montgomery County, is situated in the central region of the state. Positioned close to the juncture where the Alabama River forms from the convergence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, 
            the city's origins trace back to Native American settlements and an expedition by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1540. Around 1717, the French erected Fort Toulouse on the river, slightly north of Montgomery's present location. 
            The city officially emerged in 1819 through the merger of two settlements and was named in honor of General Richard Montgomery, who lost his life during the American Revolution. It was designated as the state capital in 1846. In February 1861, 
            on the brink of the American Civil War, Montgomery served as the inaugural capital of the Confederacy, although the capital shifted to Richmond, Virginia, later that year. Union forces seized control of Montgomery in 1865.

            Following its post-war recovery, Montgomery emerged as a pivotal hub and marketplace for commodities such as cotton, livestock, yellow pine, and hardwood. Today, services, particularly government and healthcare, 
            constitute a significant portion of the city's economy. Livestock farming and dairy production also play vital roles. The industrial sector encompasses poultry and beef processing, as well as the production of water heaters, 
            wood items, plastics, textiles, and aircraft components.

            The Capitol building holds significant historical importance, being the site where Alabama voted to secede from the Union on January 11, 1861, and where the Confederate States of America was established on February 4, 1861. 
            Notable landmarks include the First White House of the Confederacy, where Jefferson Davis resided, and the Alabama Department of Archives and History, housing a historical museum and genealogical resources. Visitors can also 
            explore attractions like the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum dedicated to the renowned author and his wife, and Old Alabama Town, a historical district showcasing life in 19th-century Alabama. 
            Montgomery boasts a ballet company and a symphony orchestra, while the Alabama Shakespeare Festival offers performances throughout much of the year. Beyond the city limits, Fort Toulouse/Jackson Park offers a glimpse into history with its reconstructed fort, 
            and Jasmine Hill Gardens and Outdoor Museum features statues, fountains, and a variety of flowers.

            In the late 1950s and 1960s, Montgomery became a pivotal site for civil rights activism. Martin Luther King, Jr., then a minister in Montgomery, spearheaded significant efforts. Following Rosa Parks' arrest in December 1955 for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man, 
            African Americans organized a peaceful boycott of the city's public buses. This led to a court order banning segregation on buses a year later. In 1965, a voter registration drive centered in Selma faced violent opposition, prompting a protest march to Montgomery, led by King. 
            The route of this historic march was designated the Selma-to-Montgomery National Historic Trail in 1996. Additionally, the Civil Rights Memorial in downtown Montgomery serves as a tribute to those who lost their lives during the civil rights movement.[1]
