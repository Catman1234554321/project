        <h2>Welcome to Iron City!</h2>
        <p>
            Birmingham, the largest city in Alabama, USA, is situated in the north-central region of the state. It holds prominence as a leading industrial center in the South. Serving as the seat of Jefferson County since 1873, 
            Birmingham is also a designated port of entry within the Mobile customs district. It stands as the focal point of a vast metropolitan area, encompassing surrounding counties like Blount, St. Clair, and Shelby, 
            as well as neighboring cities such as Bessemer, Homewood, and Fairfield.

            Located in the narrow Jones Valley at the southern terminus of the Appalachian Mountain system, the site was settled around 1813, with Elyton (now part of Birmingham) established as the county seat in 1821. 
            The convergence of east-west and north-south railroads in 1870 marked a significant turning point; the following year, the city was founded by a land company supported by railroad officials. Birmingham, 
            named after its English counterpart, swiftly emerged as the South's hub for iron and steel production. Its industrialization was driven by abundant local resources, including coal, limestone, and iron ore, crucial for steel manufacturing. 
            The area also boasted deposits of dolomite, marble, barites, bauxite, pyrite, quartz, millstone, clays, sand, and gravel. Birmingham's primary products include iron, steel, and associated goods such as cast-iron pipe and wrought-iron furniture. 
            The city's industrial landscape has evolved towards diversification, with additional output encompassing aircraft parts, fire extinguishers, chemicals, paint, electronics, furniture, paper goods, automotive components, plastics, and textiles. 
            Coal mining and high-tech industries also contribute significantly to the economy. Education, government, banking, and healthcare are key service sectors. A waterway extending from nearby Port Birmingham leads southward to the Gulf of Mexico seaport in Mobile.

            The city serves as the home to several esteemed institutions of higher education, with the largest being the University of Alabama at Birmingham, established in 1969 as a part of the state university system. Birmingham-Southern College, affiliated with the Methodist denomination, 
            was formed in 1918 through the merger of Birmingham College (founded in 1898) and Southern University, originally established in Greensboro in 1856. Samford University, founded by the Baptist community and chartered in 1841 in Marion, relocated to Birmingham in 1887 and operated 
            under the name Howard College until 1965. Miles College, affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal church, was established in 1905. Additionally, Birmingham is home to the Birmingham School of Law (founded in 1915) and Southeastern Bible College (established in 1935), along with several community colleges. 
            The city's medical center encompasses the medical and dental colleges of the University of Alabama, as well as various specialized hospitals and clinics. The Southern Research Institute, initially founded in Birmingham in 1941, now boasts facilities across multiple southern states.
